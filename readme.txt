to be interacted with on admin.html. On admin.html you can Search for bookings by entering the 5 digit BRN number you were given on booking.html. Additionally you can
leave the search field blank and it will search for all the bookings made in the last two hours. Once bookings have been found you have option to assign them to a driver
